# BIST-RL-Adder
The increasing demand for low-power and energy-
efficient computing in advanced technologies such as quantum
computing and nanotechnology has led to the emergence of
reversible logic circuits as a promising solution.

we propose a Built-In Self-Test (BIST) architecture for low-
power reversible logic adders using Fredkin and Peres gates.
The architecture integrates a low-transition Bit Swapping Linear
Feedback Shift Register (BS-LFSR) for pseudorandom pattern
generation and a Multiple Input Signature Register (MISR) for
compact response analysis.
The reversible adder serves as the
Circuit Under Test (CUT), targeting minimal energy dissipation
while ensuring high test coverage. The design is described in
Verilog and implemented on the Xilinx Vivado platform. Experi-
mental results show that the proposed BIST framework achieves
a 13.61% reduction in power consumption and a power saving
of approximately 0.5 W compared to conventional LFSR-based
designs. 
Simulation with stuck-at fault models confirms high
fault detection efficiency with minimal area and performance
overhead, demonstrating the suitability of the approach for
energy-efficient, self-testable logic systems.
